Only A-f and two of my sons teachers aren't even listed that fall in the category. So I'm not sure what you gained as all teachers aren't listed

Good work!

Even if this is a minor FU (get it) to FCPS for needlessly closing schools, I say good work.

What a pain in the ass. My kids are not happy. It is too cold to play outside for extended periods of time. Not enough snow to sled anyway. They would rather go to school and see their friends (and learn). And they understand that waiting for the bus in long johns, pants, sweater, heavy coat, gloves, scarf, hat... is not a big deal. They are not pussy bitches like most of the other kids in this area.

Anyway. Good work. And FU FCPS.

i think it's fair to release salary ammounts with names as long as it's for everyone to see. especially because they are public officials: not privately paid.

what's not fair is when only a few people know and hiding salary causes crime against others

however: private industry does NOT need to follow public policy, and in the past private industry has been sued for releasing "private" salary information (not that i agree with the outcomes: infact i don't)

I'm actually bothered that my kid's ES teachers make below 50K. And that's in what considered one of the top schools. I wouldn't mind paying more taxes if I knew it would bump up their salaries, not some admins/overheads.

194 days, 7.5 hours a day.

I doubt if most teachers don't put in more than 7.5 hours/day.

Post the Arlington Public Schools so we can compare. Also Loudoun and Falls Church City.

The teachers who make over 90K are on the cusp of retirement. They have not been making that salary for their whole career. I saw one teacher on here who has 40 years in and he could retire at any time, but he loves what he is doing and he is an excellent teacher. He is past age 70. He makes 100k and I believe he is worth every penny of that (and more). His institutional knowledge in his field is amazing. Right now he has a student teacher in his room and that woman keeps saying how lucky she is (and she is!).

I think there's a saying that goes something like think before you speak. While these dollar amounts may outrage people, like most stories there's more to this financial picture than meets the eye.
First. Not all these people work 12 months out of the year. A lot of them, teachers to be exact, only work 10 MONTHS out of the year. They are NOT paid during the months schools aren't in session. So while you rant and rave about how overpaid these people are in your world, in the real world of Fairfax County, Virginia they may be underpaid. If you've done any kind of reading in the last five years, you know that the median(average)income for all people living here is somewhere between 100 and 110 thousand dollars a year. Those statistics appear in National magazines. Fairfax and/or Loudoun Counties are always at the top or near the top of the national list. Check out US News and World Report for average incomes. I guarantee you Fairfax County Virginia as a whole averages six figure salaries. Your released numbers show that many of these employees work for far less in a year.
Second, last time I checked FCPS was the 10th largest school system in the entire United States of America. You need "quality people" to educate and manage that size of a school system. That in itself costs money. You ought to do a little more reading of the FCPS web site and try to understand what the new superintendent is trying to do in better managing the resources of the school system. Everything needs to be put into context.
I feel sorry for you that there's such a need to attack people who are trying to help prepare young people for the future. If you were paying attention in school and to legitimate news reports, you would know that this area is one of the most expensive to live in in the country. You need to pay people in order to have quality at all levels of any school system or any type of business.
Maybe you need to think about that advice that a teacher/teachers told you to do your homework more often, Do more research. Numbers are more than just figures on a page. There's a story to every situation, Also, thinking before speaking/publishing is also good advice to heed now as well as in the future.

Can't you read? It's partly because of length of service. A 55 year old PE teacher that has been working FCPS for 30 years is going to be making more money than a 31 year old math teacher that is their 6th year.

Their purpose is one of the following two things, or perhaps both..

1) they resent their taxes going to the school system, which is filled with employees they perceive to be valueless freeloaders/work less hard or know less than OP does for his/her job for similar or less money. So they have obtained this publicly available information to presumably shame the employees - and using the snow closing as a ruse (they intended to do this regardless)

2) they have a grand delusion that they can extort the school system into making a decision convenient for this one resentful person by threatening to shame and attack 25000 people who have nothing to do with the decision to close school. As if first of all, the system cares, and second, that the release of this info is some tantalizing leak of classified information, which it isnt.
